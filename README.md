# Browser Permission Tester with Enhanced Download Methods

## Features

### Enhanced Download Compatibility
The shell script generator now uses **5 advanced fallback methods** optimized for remote browser environments based on research of successful download sites:

#### Method 1: Window.open + LocalStorage (Remote Browser Optimized)
- Uses `window.open()` with temporary storage-based content passing
- Stores content in sessionStorage/localStorage temporarily
- Opens download page in new window that retrieves and downloads content
- **Most reliable for remote browsers and VMs**

#### Method 2: Form POST Download (Server-side)
- Creates hidden HTML form with POST to `/api/download-script`
- Handles both JSON and form data on server
- Uses `Content-Disposition: attachment` header
- **Works when JavaScript blob methods are blocked**

#### Method 3: Blob Download (Standard)
- Uses `Blob` API with `URL.createObjectURL()`
- `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` for better compatibility
- Works in most modern browsers locally

#### Method 4: Base64 Data URI Download
- Uses `data:application/octet-stream;base64,` URI scheme
- Base64 encoding prevents character encoding issues
- Fallback for browsers that block blob downloads

#### Method 5: Clipboard + Manual Copy (Final Fallback)
- Automatic clipboard copy if all downloads fail
- Modal dialog with textarea for manual copy
- Works even in highly restricted environments
- User-friendly instructions for manual save
